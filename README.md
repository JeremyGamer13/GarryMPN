# GarryMPN
Make simple Player Model & NPC Garry's Mod addon structures with an MDL model and VTF textures.

# Notice
This program is not complete yet.
As of now the GUI only generates proper addons if you have a materials folder with VMT files already inside.

When there is a proper v1.0.0 release out, this notice will disappear.

# Possible Errors
If you do not find your error here, try reinstalling the program.
If you still get the error on a fresh install, please [report it to the GitHub repository](https://github.com/JeremyGamer13/GarryMPN/issues).

### Error invoking remote method 'garrympn-invoke-cli'
- Make sure your error log doesn't mention non-existent paths/folders/directories. If it does, one of the folders/files you selected was deleted or not found.
- Make sure the `garrympn-cli.exe` file is in the same folder as the executable.
- Make sure the `garrympn-cli.exe` file is not renamed, or given strange capitalization.
