This program is not complete yet.
As of now the GUI does not let you configure many VMT options, including basic settings like bump maps, surface properties or phong.

When there is a proper v1.0.0 release out, this notice will disappear.

For the best instructions, please see the MANUAL.md file with a Markdown reader. You will also see a list of common errors within the manual.
If you do not have a Markdown reader, open the MANUAL.txt file. Note that it is still formatted for Markdown unlike this file.
